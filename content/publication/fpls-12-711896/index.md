abstract: "There is a need to develop new ways of protecting plants against
  aphid attack. Here, we investigated the effect of a plant defence activator,
  cis-jasmone (CJ), in a range of cultivars of Brassica napus, Brassica rapa and
  Brassica oleracea. Plants were sprayed with cis-jasmone or blank formulation
  and then tested with peach potato aphids (Myzus persicae Sulzer) (Hemiptera:
  Aphididae) and their parasitoid Diaeretiella rapae (M'Intosh) (Hymenoptera:
  Braconidae). CJ treated plants had significantly lower aphid settlement than
  control plants in a settlement bioassay. Conversely, in a foraging bioassay,
  D. rapae parasitoids spent a significantly longer time foraging on CJ treated
  plants. Our results reveal that CJ treatment makes plants less attractive to
  and less suitable for M. persicae but more attractive to D. rapae in a range
  of brassica cultivars. It is likely that these effects are due to changes in
  volatile emission indicating activation of defence and presence of conspecific
  competitors to aphids but presence of prey to parasitoids. Increases in
  volatile emission were found in CJ induced plants but varied with genotype.
  Among the synthetic volatile compounds that were induced in the headspace of
  CJ treated brassica cultivars, methyl isothiocyanate, methyl salicylate and
  cis-jasmone were most repellent to aphids. These results build on earlier
  studies in Arabidopsis and show that tritrophic interactions are influenced by
  CJ in a wide range of brassica germplasm. The implication is that CJ is a
  promising treatment that could be used in brassica crops as part of an
  integrated pest management system."
