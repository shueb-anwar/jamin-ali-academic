  BACKGROUND: Plant resistance to insects can be reduced by crop domestication
  which means their wild ancestors could provide novel sources of resistance.
  Thus, crossing wild ancestors with

  domesticated crops can potentially enhance their resistance against insects. However, a prerequisite for this is identification of sources of resistance. Here, we investigated the response of three wild potato (Solanum stoloniferum Schltdl.) accessions and cultivated potato (Solanum tuberosum) to aphid (Myzus persicae Sulzer) herbivory.

  RESULTS: Results revealed that there was a significant reduction in aphid survival and reproduction on wild potato accessions (CGN18333, CGN22718, CGN23072) compared to cultivated (Desiree) potato plants. A similar trend was observed in olfactometer bioassay; the wild accessions had a repellent effect on adult aphids. In contrast, among the tested wild potato accessions, the parasitoid Diaeretiella rapae (M’Intosh) was significantly attracted to volatiles from CGN18333. Volatile analysis showed that wild accessions emitted significantly more volatiles compared to cultivated potato. Principal component analysis (PCA) of volatile data revealed that the volatile profiles of wild and cultivated potato are dissimilar. β-Bisabolene, (E)-β-farnesene, trans-α-bergamotene, D-limonene, (E,E)-4,8,12-trimethyl-1,3,7,11-tridecatetraene (TMTT), and p-Cymen-7-ol were the main volatiles contributing to the emitted blends, suggesting possible involvement in the behavioural response of both M. persicae and D. rapae.

  CONCLUSION: Our findings show that the tested wild accessions have the potential to be used to breed aphid-resistant potatoes. This opens new opportunities to reduce the aphid damage and to enhance the recruitment of natural enemies.
