  Abstract

  Phytohormones, pivotal regulators of plant growth and development, are increasingly

  recognized for their multifaceted roles in enhancing crop resilience against environmental

  stresses. In this review, we provide a comprehensive synthesis of current

  research on utilizing phytohormones to enhance crop productivity and fortify their

  defence mechanisms. Initially, we introduce the significance of phytohormones in

  orchestrating plant growth, followed by their potential utilization in bolstering crop

  defences against diverse environmental stressors. Our focus then shifts to an indepth

  exploration of phytohormones and their pivotal roles in mediating plant

  defence responses against biotic stressors, particularly insect pests. Furthermore, we

  highlight the potential impact of phytohormones on agricultural production while

  underscoring the existing research gaps and limitations hindering their widespread

  implementation in agricultural practices. Despite the accumulating body of research

  in this field, the integration of phytohormones into agriculture remains limited. To

  address this discrepancy, we propose a comprehensive framework for investigating

  the intricate interplay between phytohormones and sustainable agriculture. This

  framework advocates for the adoption of novel technologies and methodologies to

  facilitate the effective deployment of phytohormones in agricultural settings and also

  emphasizes the need to address existing research limitations through rigorous field

  studies. By outlining a roadmap for advancing the utilization of phytohormones in

  agriculture, this review aims to catalyse transformative changes in agricultural practices,

  fostering sustainability and resilience in agricultural settings.
