abstract: The prominent cultivation of lemongrass relies on the pharmacological
  incentives of its essential oil. The lemongrass essential oil (LEO) has a
  significant amount of citral (mixture of geranial and neral), isoneral,
  isogeranial, geraniol, geranyl acetate, citronellal, citronellol,
  germacrene-D, and elemol in addition to numerous other bioactive compounds.
  These components confer various medicinal activities to LEO including
  antifungal, antibacterial, antiviral, anticancer, and antioxidant properties.
  These attributes are commercially exploited in pharmaceutical, cosmetics, and
  food preservations industries. Furthermore, the employment of LEO in the
  treatment of cancer opens a new vista in the field of therapeutics. Although
  different LEO components have shown promising anticancer activities in vitro,
  these effects have not been assessed yet in humans. Further studies on the
  anticancer mechanisms exerted by lemongrass components are required. The
  present review intends to provide a timely discussion on the relevance of
  lemongrass extracts in cancer and health treatment, and in food industry
  applications.
