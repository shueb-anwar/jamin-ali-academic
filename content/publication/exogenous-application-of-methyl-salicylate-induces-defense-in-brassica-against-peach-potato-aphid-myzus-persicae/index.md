abstract: Plants use a variety of secondary metabolites to defend themselves
  against herbivore insects. Methyl salicylate (MeSA) is a natural plant-derived
  compound that has been used as a plant defence elicitor and a herbivore
  repellent on several crop plants. The aim of this study was to investigate the
  effect of MeSA treatment of Brassica rapa subsp. chinensis (‘Hanakan’ pak
  choi) on its interactions with peach potato aphids, Myzus persicae, and their
  natural enemy, Diaeretiella rapae. For this, we selected two concentrations of
  MeSA (75 mg/L and 100 mg/L). Our results showed that aphid performance was
  significantly reduced on plants treated with MeSA (100 mg/L). In a cage
  bioassay, the MeSA (100 mg/L)-treated plants showed lower adult survival and
  larviposition. Similarly, the MeSA (100 mg/L)-treated plants had a
  significantly lower aphid settlement in a settlement bioassay. In contrast,
  the M. persicae aphids did not show any significant difference between the
  MeSA (75 mg/L)-treated and control plants. In a parasitoid foraging bioassay,
  the parasitoid D. rapae also did not show any significant difference in the
  time spent on MeSA-treated and control plants. A volatile analysis showed that
  the MeSA treatment induced a significant change in volatile emissions, as high
  numbers of volatile compounds were detected from the MeSA-treated plants. Our
  results showed that MeSA has potential to induce defence in Brassica against
  M. persicae and can be utilised in developing sustainable approaches for the
  management of peach potato aphids.
