As an applied entomologist specialising in Chemical Ecology, my research insect-plant interaction, by exploring induced plant defense mechanisms, I strive to pioneer innovative solutions for Integrated Pest Management, contributing to sustainable Pest Management practices. My expertise lies in harnessing the power of semiochemicals to develop novel tools, ensuring the effective and environmentally conscious management of phytophagous insect pests across diverse agricultural landscape.
