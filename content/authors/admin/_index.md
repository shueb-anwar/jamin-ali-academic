I am an applied insect chemical ecologist whose expertise lies at the interface of ecology, biology, and chemistry. My research focuses on using insect and plant derived semiochemicals to develop novel tools for sustainable management of phytophagous insect pests in global agricultural environments. I am also interested in developing data-driven approaches to inform integrated pest management decisions in horticultural production systems.
