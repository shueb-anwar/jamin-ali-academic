  - title: Insect Performance Bioassay
    content: 'Clip-cages are a useful experimental tool for confining small insects to study their performance i.e. survival, fecundity and/or other biological parameters. Clip-cages are usually cheap, extremely light, and easy to make and handle, and which has less of the negative, damaging nature of traditional cages.'

  - title: Plant Headspace Sampling
    content: 'Headspace sampling can be used to collect volatile compounds from living odour sources such as intact plants. Dynamic headspace analysis, commonly referred to as air entrainment, involves drawing clean air over the odour source (e.g. a plant) and then through an adsorbent polymer that collects the volatile compounds. Volatile compounds are then removed either by thermal desorbtion or by eluting with a solvent'

  - title: Insect Behavioural Bioassay
    content: 'The behavioural activity of volatile compounds can be studied using olfactometers. These usually involve a container in which an insect is placed which is sealed except for a number of channels through which air carrying test odours is drawn. Insects inside the olfactometer are able to move around and ‘choose’ an odour source. The four-arm olfactometer records time spent in each region and therefore makes no distinction between attraction and arrestment or between repulsion and locomotion stimulation but can be initially useful in establishing a behavioural response to a semiochemical where the nature of the response is unknown.'

- title: Plant Chemical Analysis
    content: 'Gas chromatography (GC) is an analytical separation method. It is a rapid technique and can separate a wide range of compounds at a high resolution but the analytes have to be sufficiently volatile. Gas chromatography can be coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS). In mass spectrometry, a substance is bombarded with an electron beam fragmenting the molecule and from this a tentative identification of the substance can be made. Tentative identification can be confirmed by performing peak enhancement co-injection on a number of different column types in a GC.'
